## Description

This service handles BMC interactions.

- machine and BMC power on/off/reset
- setting next boot device
- user management
- setting BMC network source

PBnJ started out as an HTTP server, listening by default on port 9090.
This HTTP server (not the gRPC server) is scheduled for deprecation and not enabled by default.
To enable the HTTP server, you must run PBnJ with `pbnj server --enableHTTP` or `PBNJ_ENABLEHTTP=true pbnj server`.
The gRPC PBnJ server listens by default on port 50051.
This can be started with `pbnj server`.
Use `pbnj server --help` for more runtime details.

> This dual-stack functionality is intended to ease the upgrade path and provide existing HTTP server users with user management functionality.
> Please note that the HTTP server is deprecated and will shortly be removed.
> If just getting starting with PBnJ, please use the gRPC server.
